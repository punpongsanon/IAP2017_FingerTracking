# IAP2017: Build your own Multi-Touch Pad

Learn laser cutting, electronics breadboard prototyping, soldering, and computer vision in only two afternoons. In this hands-on IAP, we will build a multi-touch pad using the principles of FTIR (Frustrated Total Internal Reflection).

This code is the part of Session #2: Finger tracking (Jan 20, 2017). 
In the second session, you will use computer vision to track finger gestures on your multi-touch pad using the attached camera. 
For this, we will give an intro to computer vision with OpenCV (color-space conversions, thresholding, blob detection). 
At the end, we will host a contest for the best example application with some unique prizes for the most creative solutions.

Pre-requirement:

* We run all this example in 'python version' of OpenCV. 
- [OpenCV 2.4.13](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)

- [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- Numpy, please run with 'pip install numpy'
